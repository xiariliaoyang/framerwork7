// Initialize app and store it to myApp variable for futher access to its methods
var myApp = new Framework7();
 
// We need to use custom DOM library, let's save it to $$ variable:
var $$ = Dom7;
 
// Add view
var mainView = myApp.addView('.view-main', {
  // Because we want to use dynamic navbar, we need to enable it for this view:
  dynamicNavbar: true
});
 
// Now we need to run the code that will be executed only for About page.
 
// Option 1. Using page callback for page (for "about" page in this case) (recommended way):
myApp.onPageInit('about', function (page) {
  // Do something here for "about" page
  myApp.alert("进入about页面");
  
})
